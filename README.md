Consumer finance providers often face significant challenges when issuing loans due to two major factors:

1. Lack of Credit History: This can stem from various reasons such as young age, a preference for cash transactions, or recent relocation from a different country. These factors can negatively impact a customer's ability to get approved for a loan.

2. Volatility of Scorecards: Scorecards, which are models that predict loan risk, must be regularly updated to reflect the dynamic nature of clients' habits. Client behaviors evolve constantly, necessitating frequent updates to these models. This process is time-consuming and often reactive, occurring after a client has already missed a payment.

To address these challenges, it is crucial to develop models that remain stable over time. Achieving stability can be complex and often requires trade-offs, as improving model stability can sometimes compromise performance.

The goal of this notebook is to build a machine learning model that maintains stability over time while addressing the aforementioned challenges.
